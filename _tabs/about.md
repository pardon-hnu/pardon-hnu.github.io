# Dong Pan (潘东)
Hellow! My name is dong pan, a Ph. D student at Hunan university.

## Education
- I get my bachelor's degree from Hunan University (2017.09.01->2021.06.30)
- I am accepted to be a master student at Hunan University (2021.09.01)
- I become a Ph.D student changed from master student at Hunan University (2022.09.01->now)

## Research
I'm currently working on two fields:
1. Cohesive Subgraph Analysis
   - maximum k-biplex search over bipartite graph.
   - structural graph clustering over hypergraph.
2. Accelarating Graph Computing with FPGA
   - FPGA-based maximum k-biplex heuristic search algorithm.

## Publication
1. Accelerating maximum biplex search over large bipartite graphs, VLDB Journal, 2024 (CCF-A, first author, published).
2. Efficient Structural Clustering over Hypergraphs, ICDE, 2025 (CCF-A, first author, accepted).
3. A Design of Network Reconfigurable Universal CNN Accelerator Based on FPGA, JPDC, 2024 (CCF-B, 5-th author, under review)
